This repo contains the code accompanying our paper Cross-database and cross-channel electrocardiogram arrhythmia heartbeat classification based on unsupervised domain adaptation published in Expert Systems with Applications.

We propose a novel method for efficiently classifying arrhythmic heartbeats in ECG signals across various domains. We present a domain-adaptive deep network based on optimizing cross-domain feature discrepancies. Our method addresses the issue of limited labeled training samples and data distribution shifts across different domains.
